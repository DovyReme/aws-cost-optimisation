# S3 Cost Optimisation

## Storage Classes and moving

- Intelligent-Tiering - best for most workloads. (<128KB)
- Lifecycles
  - When Access patterns are known.
  - You need to transition into colder storage classes
- Direct PUTs (Standard) best for small files (>128KB)

## Tooling to review service usage

- AWS Cost explorer (export into csv..)
- Storage Lens ()
- AWS Cost & Usage Report
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS Service Logs (Server access logs, CloudTrail data events (needs enabling)
- S3 Inventory Report (Storage classes, counts, sizes of objects etc.)

## Pay attention to
- Versioning Enabled Buckets
- Multipart Upload Processes (MPUs). If any issues, it might be incomplete MPUs and storage still counts. Go and create lifecycle rule to delete them.

## Data Transfer

- IN - Free, within buckets, same region.
- OUT - Paid. Saving options by:
  - Implementing CloudFront. Performance benefits.
  - Reduce amount of bytes. Run compute and reduce rate.
  - For CROSS region replication use destination bucket storage class to colder.
  - Buckets in same region as compute

## API
### API Cost Factors
- Storage Class impact on API costs
- Indirect API requests
- Data Retrievals (amount of object matter overall)
